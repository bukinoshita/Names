# Names
> List of names

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! A few guidelines:

- Keep diffs short. One name at a time is probably best.
- Propose common names instead of uncommon names like **Facebookson**.
- Male names should go to the male file, female names should go to the female file and if the name is common for both, please add to both files.

## Structure
Each language should be in a sorted, UTF-8 encoded file "Names/[ISO 639-1 code].txt".
